Pragmatic Issue Tracker based on Markdown, VsCode and your version control system.

## Setup

Create a folder "issues" in the root of your workspace.
You can also create the "issues" folder elsewhere (e.g. under "docs" folder) but then u have to open VSCode from this folder.

Sub folders are supported.

## Template

You can setup a template for new issues by creating a ".template" file in the root of the "issues" folder.

## No status in tree view?

This issue explorer is meant to be very, very simple. The idea is: existing issues are open issues,
solved issues are simply deleted.
